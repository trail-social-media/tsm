## Initial Brainstorming Ideas
* Finance App that helps people make smart decisions to budget their spending.
* Hiking App that allows users to save trails they have hiked and share these trails with others (social media for hikers)
* Recipe App that suggests different food that you can make based on what you have in the house
* Timer App that is very customizable, allowing timers to be set for situations where the basic phone timer is not enough.
* Charity App that helps connect charities with people willing to donate to specific causes

## Top 3 Ideas
### Finance App
* This app is a great idea since most people are always struggling to find ways to save money or budget expenses
* The app can provide useful tips and tricks to help people cut back on spending or suggest deals for them
* The problem with creating such an app is that we would need to do a lot of research ourselves before we can create the content required for this

### Hiking App
* This app can basically be like social media for hikers where they save trails they have hiked and can share these as posts to other hikers.
* The primary problem we will face is that it will be difficult to figure out how to create and save trails for users when creating such an app.

### Charity App
* This app is a great idea since many people want to donate to a cause they care about but it's difficult to find a charity that matches their interests
* While this app may be easy to implement, it could be difficult gaining traction since we would also need to have charities that are willing to be featured in the app.


## Final App Idea

### Hiking App
* We think this will be the best type of app to create since it sounds like a unique idea that may not have been done before.
* This app idea also seems do-able since we can use Apple's MapKit, which should allow us to create and save trails for users.
* It may be diffuclt to incorporate the social media aspect of the app since we will have to figure out a way to store trails on the server but the rest of the functionality can definitely be implemented.
